# Backpropagation
__________________
If you are building your own neural network, you will definitely need to understand how to train it. Backpropagation is a commonly used technique for training neural network. 

## Prerequisites
_________________

#### Python3 Installation :

-> Python3 : https://www.python.org/downloads/

#### Jupyter-Notebook Installation :

-> If you want to run ipython notebook(.ipynb file), So for run this file you need jupyter-notebook, if not already installed in your machine check below link for installation :
https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html


## Initialization
__________________

* Sigmoid function (1/(1 + exp(-x)))
* Unit vector ( X )
* Target value that we want to predict using backpropagation
* Learning rate ( &alpha; )
* Weight for Input &Rightarrow; Hidden layer.

# Feed-Forward
_______________
We will use given weights and inputs to predict the output. Inputs are multiplied by weights and then the results are passed forward to the next layer.

## 2. For run the Jupyter-Notebook :
_______________________________________

-> Type jupyter-notebook in your terminal.

-> Go to Jupyter Navigation Bar -> Select 'Cell' -> Select 'Run All'


# All set !!!
