# Backpropagation
This file contains two process :
### * backpropagation  
### * feed-forward

For doing these process we required following :
## Initialization

* Sigmoid function
* Unit vector ( X )
* Target value that we want to predict using backpropagation
* Learning rate ( &alpha; )
* Weight for &Boldi; nput &Rightarrow; Hidden layer.
