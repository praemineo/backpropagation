# Backpropagation
This file contains two process :
### * backpropagation  
### * feed-forward

For doing these process we required following :
## Initialization

* Sigmoid function {\displaystyle S(x)={\frac {1}{1+e^{-x}}}={\frac {e^{x}}{e^{x}+1}}.}
* Unit vector ( X )
* Target value that we want to predict using backpropagation
* Learning rate ( &alpha; )
* Weight for Input &Rightarrow; Hidden layer.
