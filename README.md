# Backpropagation
This file contains two process :
#### Backpropagation  
#### Feed-forward

For doing these process we required following :
### Initialization

* Sigmoid function (1/(1 + \exp(-x)))
* Unit vector ( X )
* Target value that we want to predict using backpropagation
* Learning rate ( &alpha; )
* Weight for Input &Rightarrow; Hidden layer.

## Feed-Forward
We will use given weights and inputs to predict the output. Inputs are multiplied by weights and then the results are passed forward to the next layer.
