# Backpropagation
If you are building your own neural network, you will definitely need to understand how to train it. Backpropagation is a commonly used technique for training neural network. 

## Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

For doing these process we required following :
## Initialization

* Sigmoid function (1/(1 + \exp(-x)))
* Unit vector ( X )
* Target value that we want to predict using backpropagation
* Learning rate ( &alpha; )
* Weight for Input &Rightarrow; Hidden layer.

# Feed-Forward
We will use given weights and inputs to predict the output. Inputs are multiplied by weights and then the results are passed forward to the next layer.
