# Backpropagation
If you are building your own neural network, you will definitely need to understand how to train it. Backpropagation is a commonly used technique for training neural network. 

## Prerequisites
1. Python : https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. If you want to run ipython notebook(.ipynb file), So for run this file you need jupyter-notebook, if not already installed in your machine check below link for installation :
https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

and for run the notebook, type -> jupyter-notebook in your terminal

## Initialization

* Sigmoid function (1/(1 + exp(-x)))
* Unit vector ( X )
* Target value that we want to predict using backpropagation
* Learning rate ( &alpha; )
* Weight for Input &Rightarrow; Hidden layer.

# Feed-Forward
We will use given weights and inputs to predict the output. Inputs are multiplied by weights and then the results are passed forward to the next layer.
